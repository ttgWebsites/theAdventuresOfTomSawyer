					<li data-theme="b">The hypocrisy of society</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Much like in Twain's buck Huck Finn society is detailed as being very hypocritical</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Twain often mocks the institutions of schools and churches, and makes one wonder about the justness of laws</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He criticizes the practices taught to children, as the values learned, particularly in the 19th century southern US, are slightly ridiculous</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He shows the children in the story as very superstitious, perhaps making fun of the emphasis on religion the adults in the town have</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Also one particular example of hypocrisy relates to Injun Joe. Injun Joe commits the murder that captivates the town</li>
					<li data-theme="c">All the citizens want him captured and strung up, however when he eventually does die, they seem to show remorse for him</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Tom's maturation	</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He manages to mature both morally and socially throughout the novel</li>
					<li data-theme="c">At the beginning Tom pulls childish pranks often and is also very interested in playing childish games</li>
					<li data-theme="d">However his mischievous ways get him into some intense situations such as witnessing a murder and getting lost in a cave</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Through these situations he manages to take on much more responsibility, hone up to his actions, and increase his maturity greatly, he even recognizes that being civilized isn't as bad as an option anymore</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Social exclusion</li>
					<li data-theme="d">St. Petersburg is a very small community, and everyone is well connected with one another</li>
					<li data-theme="c">However there are a few people that seem to be excluded from the community, Huck is one of them</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Huck's father is very poor, neglects him, and is often drunk. Many of the citizens want nothing to do with Huck and forbid their children from playing with them</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Injun Joe is also considered an outsider, as he is not like everyone else, for one he is an Indian</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It seems that having some sort of financial stability allows one to be socially included</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Following the discover of the treasure, Huck is very rich, and many of the citizens want to civilize him</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Huck comes to realize that being excluded from society is his preference, as being included means a loss of freedom</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Superstitions</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Tom and Huck are both very superstitious from the very beginning of the novel</li>
					<li data-theme="c">They seem to have a superstition in every possible situation, and often times they manipulate the superstition to suit their needs</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Twain seems to suggest childhood superstition is very similar to religion, in that it is very convenient to the one practicing it</li>
